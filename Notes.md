## GGUF

The model files are GGUF.

> GGUF, introduced by the llama.cpp team on August 21, 2023, replaces the
> unsupported GGML format. GGUF boasts extensibility and future-proofing
> through enhanced metadata storage. Its upgraded tokenization code now fully
> accommodates special tokens, promising improved performance, especially for
> models utilizing new special tokens and custom prompt templates.
